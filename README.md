```
Simply enter a task in the appropriate time slot and click the save button. When you refresh the page your input will stay on the page and be saved in local storage. You can choose to delete the data for a new day with the delete button at the bottom of the page. The rows are color coded and will change to show whether the hour is in the past present or future. This application is mobile responsive and will size accordingly when being viewed on a cellphone or a smaller screen.
